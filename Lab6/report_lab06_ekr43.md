## Try some Python code on the Pi

**How do you know what the shell script is doing?**

**How do we use ``vosk`` to recognize words and phrases?**

**Include the output of vosk recognizing phrases you taught it to look for.**

**Include the listing for a shell script and model files that you use to get vosk to recognize these phrases.**


## Connect the Arduino and the RPi

### Hello Pi, Hello Arduino

**What would you change to make sayHelloPi say something else?**

**How could you make it so that the Pi would only say something if the lights came on in the room?**

**How could you make it so that the Pi would say different things based on different sensor values read by the Arduino?**

**Next, try out ``HelloArduino``. First have ``HelloArduino.ino`` listen for messages from ``HelloArduino.py``. Next, use ``morse_code_translator.ino``. What happens differently?**

## Your own voice agent 

**Record someone trying out your design**
